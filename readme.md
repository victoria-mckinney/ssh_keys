#### 1. Create an SSH key locally: 
###### While in Terminal working directory:

    ssh-keygen 

###### You should see online instructions for a passphase etc, ie: 


        Enter file in which to save the key (ie Users/<username>.ssh/id_edxxxxx): <filename>.txt
        Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <passwordphrase>
        Enter same passphrase again: <passwordphrase>
        Your identification has been saved in <filename>.txt
        Your public key has been saved in <filename>.txt.pub
        The key fingerprint is:
        SHA256fdsfdsfssf:s6MNdsndjndjsndsjndsjnsjdnjskfl0suE7dfsfsfsdfsfsdfgoo9re+dHFuhwn87LVcFeewqewqwqLgNg
        The key's randomart image is:
        +--[EDXXXXX 256]--+
        |       o  o .o . |
        |      . o.oE. + o|
        |    . . .o. *  . |
        |     ..oo  =  .  |
        |     .++o...+.   |
        |     .==.o..o.   |

> **Note:** If you open the *<filename>.txt* file (or whatever you have named it)you will see something like the following:

        -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
        b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW
        QyNTUxOQAAACCNY/+maty4mamQOcEOW31cExoZgjUakXw73PgJnbX5bAAAALCeAnvangJ7

        Jvb2sgQWlyAQIDBA==
        -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

#### 2. Starting the SSH Agent:

###### In Terminal: 
                
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

---
#### 3. Configuring SSH to use the SSH agent (macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later)

###### 1. Check if the SSH config file exists: 
Use *open ~/.ssh/config* to see if the file exists. If it doesn't, you will need to create it.
###### 2. Create the SSH config file if necessary: 
Use *touch ~/.ssh/config* to create the file.

###### 3. Open the config file:
You can use a text editor to open the file, e.g.,          *vim ~/.ssh/config*

###### 4. Modify the config file:
 Add the following lines to the file, adjusting the *IdentityFile* path if your SSH key has a different name or location:

        Host github.com
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        UseKeychain yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_edxxxx


> **Note:** If you didn't set a passphrase for your key, omit the *UseKeychain yes* line. If you encounter a configuration error, try adding *IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain* under a specific Host definition.

---
#### 4. Adding your SSH key to the SSH agent:
        
###### Use the following command, ensuring to replace *id_edxxxxx* with the name of your key: 

        ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_edxxxxx


> This adds your SSH key to the ssh-agent and stores your passphrase in the keychain, making it so you don't have to enter the passphrase every time the key is used.

> **Note:** The *-apple-use-keychain* option helps store the passphrase in your keychain when adding an SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you do not have a passphrase or are not using an Apple device, adjust the command accordingly.

> **Note:** Please also **remember to add your newly-generated SSH key** to your **[Github account](https://github.com/settings/keys)**. 
---
#### 5. Clone the repository ((....finally :/ :D)

###### Find the SSH URL of the repository and run: 
                
      git clone git@github.com:user/repository.git

> **Note:** Make sure to replace github.com:user/repository.git with the actual path to your repository.

---
> 
> #### Optional recommendations for SSH:
> **Specify an SSH key:** If you want to use a specific SSH key, you can modify the ssh command using the i option: ssh -i /path/to/private/key.
>
> **For Git operations, set the GIT_SSH_COMMAND environment variable:** export GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i /path/to/private/key".
>
>**Debugging SSH:** Use *ssh -T git@github.com* (replace *github.com *with your *Git server*) to test your SSH connection.
